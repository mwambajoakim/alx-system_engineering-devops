# <ins>Processes and Signals</ins>

- A process is a job or piece of work running in the system. It could be a database for a webapp or a command that is finding something in the system. Processes have IDs called PIDs. These are what identify each and are a way to pinpoint one for particular processing in the Linux environment. For example if I would like to end a process I just need to `kill [PID]`.

-  On the other hand, a signal is an interrupt that is sent to a process. This can be to kill it, pause it, or make it go to sleep among other signals.
