- What is an IP address?

1. Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses

2. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`
- Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
1. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
2. `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`
- Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
1. `Have you received boxes x, y, z?`

## 04 - This Bash script displays listening ports:
- That only shows listening sockets
- That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

## 05 - This Bash script pings an IP address passed as an argument.
- Accepts a string as an argument
- Displays `Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}` if no argument passed
- Ping the IP 5 times
